Finding Driving Lanes with Computer Vision methods using Open CV.
Hough transform and canny edge detection are feature extraction algorithms to identify specific features within the images. 

Using simple computer vision, a pipeline was generated to obtain / identify distinct driving lanes on the image of the road. The same pipeline is used to further idenfity lane markers in a small video.

The methods can be further improved using advanced computer vision and deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Nets etc.
